        <h1>Anti-xSxJ Manifesto</h1>
        <blockquote>
        "A system optimized only for one type is a system that malfunctions for the rest."
        </blockquote>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <p>This manifesto is not a hate speech. It is a structured critique of the overrepresentation and normative dominance of the <strong>xSxJ</strong> cognitive type in organizational, educational, and societal systems.</p>
        <p>If you're an xSxJ, this is not personal. But if you believe your sense of "common sense" should govern everyone, this <strong>is</strong> about you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
        <p>We live in a world designed by and for the xSxJ.<br />A world where:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>"Unwritten rules" are treated as law.</li>
        <li>"Common sense" is just the local logic of the majority.</li>
        <li>"Predictability" is considered virtue, and "non-linearity" is framed as immaturity.</li>
        <li>Being "on time" is more important than being "right."</li>
        <li>Deviation is penalized before it's understood.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This manifesto exists because <strong>those of us who operate on intuition, possibilities, and creative deviation are systemically punished</strong> for not conforming to a structure we never agreed to.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Core Statement</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>That "common sense" is a political technology, not a moral truth.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>That prioritizing Sensing-Judging cognitive styles in policies, workflows, and cultures creates systemic exclusion.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>That the diversity of cognition is not optional — it is essential for any adaptive, intelligent society.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>That Ne, Ni, Ti, Fi — and all other functions — deserve equal architectural consideration in societal systems.</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>To refactor environments so they support multiple MBTI cognitive styles, not just one.</li>
        <li>To make unwritten rules obsolete, replaced with transparency and opt-in agreements.</li>
        <li>To shift from obedience-based trust models to autonomy-based collaboration.</li>
        <li>To advocate for systems that celebrate deviation as innovation, not defect.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What This Is Not</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>This is not a call to erase xSxJ people. It is a call to stop designing systems as if only they exist.</li>
        <li>This is not about personality wars. It's about <strong>infrastructural oppression disguised as etiquette.</strong></li>
        </ul>
